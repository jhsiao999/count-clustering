The distance method used euclidean and the linkage used was average linkage. Color scale provided in the figure. It seems that for admixture model heatmap, all the Muscle-skeletal and Heart Left-Ventricle samples cluster separately, while for the hierarchical model heatmap, they are mixed with each other. This suggests Admixture is better equipped at picking tissue separation than hierarchical clustering.}

Quite clearly, brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere seem to be dominated by the blue cluster while the Spinal cord and Substantia nigra by the cyan cluster. Prior marker based approaches have verified (?) that $80 \%$ of cells in brain cerebellum correspond to neurons. So, the blue cluster seems to be driven by the neuron cell type. This fact is further attested by the gene annotations of the top genes driving the blue cluster (Subsection 3.3).}

For instance, Muscle Skeletal and Heart tissue samples separate out at $p_{thin}=0.0001$ but cluster together at $p_{thin}=0.001$ for the same number of topics.}

It is found that the admixture model is able to distinguish the clusters better in the first set up compared to the second. Even from gene annotations point of view, it is found that the admixture model is able to extract the truly significantly enriched genes for the clusters in the first set up but fails to do so in the second set up.}

As a result, the performance of the admixture model deteriorates. Also, for a broad part of the phase space, though the admixture model does not manage to determine the admixture proportions well enough (\textit{omega match} does not hold) but it is able to extract the actually important genes driving the clusters (\textit{theta match} holds).}
