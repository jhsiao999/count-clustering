\section{Results}

%An outline for results  (under consideration)
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Form two separate subsections, one for the GTEx Version 4 data and the other for the single cell Zeisel data.
%
%\item For GTEx data, give a figure comprising of 4 Structure plots for different $K$s, may be $2,5,10,15$. Fix the thinning parameter $p_{thin}$ to say $0.0001$.  Also record the log likelihoods (Bayes factors) for each of the 4 models, as reported by \textbf{maptpx}. 
%
%\item Have one figure showing the robustness of the clustering method on the thinning parameter $p_{thin}$. Fix $k=10$ and vary $p_{thin}$ to be $0.0001$, $0.001$ and $0.01$. 
%
%\item One t-SNE plot for GTEx samples (with and without admixture in the same plot). Should this be in results or in discussions? Also the t-SNE probably would require an electronic supplemental file as I would need the \textbf{qtlcharts} highlighting for those plots. 
%
%\item The GTEX brain samples Structure plot  for $K=4$ that shows the neuron cell types in brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere. That is to show that the clusters are driven by cell types.
%
%\item Gene annotations for the GTEx significant genes (for brain) and also for the general set up (to decide on which $K$ to fix). Use Bayes Factor?
%
%\item The Structure plot for Zeisel single cell data. again Multiple $K=2,5,7,10$. 
%
%\item Gene annotations for the Zeisel single cell data. Need to choose the optimal $K$. Use Bayes Factor?
%
%\item t-SNE plot of the admixture proportions??..Is that required? Depends on how we present t-SNE. If this goes to discussion, we will avoid it here

We begin by illustrating our method on the tissue level data from the  GTEx project (V6 dbGaP accession phs000424.v6.p1, release date: Oct 19, 2015, \url{http://www.gtexportal.org/home/}) read counts data.  RNA-seq data was obtained from $8555$ samples collected from $450$ donors across $51$ tissues and $2$ cell-lines. We collected a set of $16069$ cis-genes that fulfilled some quality criteria (gene list available in \url{https://github.com/stephenslab/count-clustering/blob/master/utilities/gene_names_GTEX_V6.txt}).  \\[1 pt]
 \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}} presents the Structure plot for admixture model fit for $K=15$. The Structure plot clearly highlights the similarity among the samples coming from the same tissue and also gives an idea about which tissues have similar patterns of gene expression. It is  pretty nice that all the Brain tissues seem to cluster together and show very similar patterns, the same being true for the arteries (Artery-aorta, Artery-tibial and Artery-coronary). Interestingly, Nerve Tibial  and Adipose tissues (Adipose Subcutaneous and Adipose Visceral (Omentum)) also seem to be very close in their clustering patterns. \\[1 pt]
 As observed from the Structure plot, some tissues seem to be assigned to separate clusters for $K=15$, (e.g: Pancreas, Whole Blood), but other tissues are represented as an "admixed" version of multiple clusters (e.g: Thyroid). But in these latter cases, the samples coming from the same tissue all seem to be cluster together as they have very similar patterns of "admixing" of different clusters. A different way of visualizing the results, which highlights the clustering and separation of the different tissues on a 2D projection space (see \textbf{Supplementary Fig 1 [url]}). \\[1 pt]
 In order to get a sense of the biological interpretation of the clusters in  \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}}, we performed cluster annotation (see Methods and Materials). In \textbf{Tab~\ref{tab:tab1}}, we present the gene IDs, names and a short summary of their functions, obtained from the \textbf{mygene} package in R \cite{Thompson2014}. As seen from the table, \textit{PRSS1}(protease serine 1), \textit{CPA1} (carboxypeptidase) and \textit{PNLIP} (pancreatic lipase) are the  top three genes that drive the cluster separating pancreas from the other tissues in the admixture model in \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}}. Similarly, \textit{HBB} (hemoglobin, beta), \textit{HBA2} (hemoglobin, alpha 2) and \textit{HBA1} (hemoglobin, alpha 1) seem to be the top three genes that distinguish the whole blood and for a separate cluster from the rest. Overall it seems from \textbf{Tab~\ref{tab:tab1}} that cluster annotation is highlighting tissue specific functions and pathways.\\[2 pt]

%A field of very active interest in recent times is to estimate the proportion of different cell types in different tissues. Marker based approaches are usually adopted to validate for different cell types and get a sense of the abundance of different cell types in the tissue samples \cite{Grun2015} \cite{Palmer2005}. The admixture model is a marker free method to obtain clusters driven by cell types. 

\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}} Structure plot and the corresponding cluster annotation mainly highlighted inter tissue variation in the clusters, which is pretty logical because the cells in different tissues are pretty differentiated. We were curious if we can extract some cell type information if we focus on samples from a particular tissue or similar tissues. \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig2}} shows the Structure plot for $K=4$ on just the Brain samples data. Brain Cerebellum and Cerebellar hemisphere stand out in the plot as we see one cluster (blue) explaining around $80-85 \%$ admixture proportion. Recent stereological approaches have shown that rat cerebellum contains $> 80 \%$ neurons (Herculano-Houzel and Lent 2005) \cite{Houzel2005}, much higher than other parts of the brain. We performed cluster annotation (Supplementary Table 1) and observed that the pivotal genes that separated out the blue cluster in brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere were SNAP25 (synaptosomal-associated protein, 25kDa), ENO2 (enolase 2- gamma, neuronal) and CHGB (chromogranin B) all of which were associated with neuronal activities. It is definitely not true that the blue cluster represents the neuron cell type as it does not show up in other parts of the Brain, but it seems to be driven by neuronal cell type.\\[3 pt]

We next sought to demonstrate more quantitatively the utility of the model based clustering compared to other non model based clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering. In \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig3}}, we consider every pair of tissues from the list of tissues in GTEX with number of samples $> 50$. Then we generated a set of $50$ samples randomly drawn from the pooled set of samples coming from these two tissues and then observed whether the hierarchical and the admixture were separating out samples coming from the two different tissues. The same remains true for data sets thinned to simulate the level of lower coverage data that might be observed in single cell experiments (the threshold parameter $p_{thin}=0.0001$ taken on comparing the GTEx data with Jaitin \textit{et al} data \cite{Jaitin2014}). Check  \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:figS2}} for demonstration.  \\[1 pt]

For the thinned data, though the cluster quality is poor compared to the original data, it still seems that the clustering patterns remain preserved to a great extent. \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig4}} presents the Structure plot for $K=12$ for the GTEx thinned data with $p_{thin}=0.0001$. Many of the features from \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}} are restored even after thinning, for instance the Brain tissues clustering together, Heart samples and Muscle Skeletal samples showing similar patterns. This implies that Admixture as a clustering technique is pretty robust to the coverage of the data. \\[1 pt]

We applied the admixture model on a couple of single cell datasets due to Jaitin \textit{et al} \cite{Jaitin2014} and Zeisel \textit{et al} \cite{Zeisel2015}.  Jaitin \textit{et al} sequenced around $4000$ single cells from mouse spleen, where the cells were a heterogeneous mix enriched for expression of CD11c marker.  The aim of their study was to separate out the B cells, NK cells, pDCs and monocytes.  However the biological effect in their study was completely confounded with the amplification and sequencing batches.  \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig5}} (top panel) presents the Structure plot  for $K=7$ for the Jaitin \textit{et al} data with the samples arranged by their amplification batch (which was a refinement of the sequencing batch). \\[1 pt]

Zeisel \textit{et al} analyzed the single cell data obtained from mouse cortex and hippocampus and obtained 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the region. They also identified many marker genes informative about cell types, morphology and location.  \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig5}} (bottom panel) presents the Structure plot for  $K=10$ on their data, where the samples in Structure plot are grouped by their subclass assignment and are in the same order as the data presented within each group. It was interesting that the first few samples under Oligo6 seemed to show some "admixing" due to red cluster,which was not observed in other Oligo6 samples. These samples in Oligo6 were pretty different in pattern from the rest of Oligo6 samples which had no trace of red cluster. Since within each group, the samples are ordered in the same order as reported in the dataset, there is a possibility that adjacent samples may be coming from same plate or may be sequenced in same lane etc, all of which can lead to similar patterns. \\[1 pt]
The main highlight of \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig5}} is that one must be careful about interpreting Admixture results or any clustering results, as there is a possibility of technical effects driving the clusters instead of true biological effects. There has been a growing concern among biostatisticians today about how to deal with batch effects \cite{Leek2010} \cite{Hicks2015}. 


%We find that admixture model is more successful in separating out different tissues in general, compared to the hierarchical clustering technique. The admixture model is essentially a count based modeling approach and seems to handle low counts and zero counts much better than the hierarchical method which is a more general approach to clustering. Since the RNA-seq data and in particular scRNA-seq data have lots of low counts and zero counts, the admixture model seems to be more suited for such data compared to hierarchical clustering method. 

%Currently there is a lot of interest in single cell sequencing as it is more informative about individual cell expression profiles compared to the RNA-seq on tissue samples. We were curious to see how stable the Admixture results are if the GTEx RNA-seq data is viewed at the scale of a single cell data. We achieve the latter by thinning the GTEx data under thinning parameter $p_{thin}=0.0001$ which is the order of scale obtained by dividing the total library size of the Jaitin \textit{et al} \cite{Jaitin2014} with respect to the library size of the GTEx V4 read counts data. We fitted the admixture model for $K=12$ on the thinned data and the Structure plot for the fitted model is presented in \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig4}}. It seems that most of the features observed in \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig1}} seem to be retained, for instance- the Brain samples clustering together, Whole blood and Testis forming separate clusters, Muscle skeletal and Heart tissue samples showing very similar patterns etc. However, thinning indeed shrinks the small differences across tissues and makes it more difficult to distinguish between tissues, as evident from the comparative study of hierarchical and admixture models, analogous to \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:fig3}}, for thinned data with thinning parameters $p_{thin}=0.001$ and $p_{thin}=0.0001$ in  \textbf{Fig \ref{fig:figS2}}. One can see that with thinning, the performance of admixture model in separating the tissues deteriorates but encouragingly, it seems that admixture does outperform the hierarchical clustering even under thinned data. \\[3pt]
