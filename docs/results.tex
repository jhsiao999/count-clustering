\section{Results}

An outline for results  (under consideration)

\begin{itemize}

\item Form two separate subsections, one for the GTEx Version 4 data and the other for the single cell Zeisel data.

\item For GTEx data, give a figure comprising of 4 Structure plots for different $K$s, may be $2,5,10,15$. Fix the thinning parameter $p_{thin}$ to say $0.0001$.  Also record the log likelihoods (Bayes factors) for each of the 4 models, as reported by \textbf{maptpx}. 

\item Have one figure showing the robustness of the clustering method on the thinning parameter $p_{thin}$. Fix $k=10$ and vary $p_{thin}$ to be $0.0001$, $0.001$ and $0.01$. 

\item One t-SNE plot for GTEx samples (with and without admixture in the same plot). Should this be in results or in discussions? Also the t-SNE probably would require an electronic supplemental file as I would need the \textbf{qtlcharts} highlighting for those plots. 

\item The GTEX brain samples Structure plot  for $K=4$ that shows the neuron cell types in brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere. That is to show that the clusters are driven by cell types.

\item Gene annotations for the GTEx significant genes (for brain) and also for the general set up (to decide on which $K$ to fix). Use Bayes Factor?

\item The Structure plot for Zeisel single cell data. again Multiple $K=2,5,7,10$. 

\item Gene annotations for the Zeisel single cell data. Need to choose the optimal $K$. Use Bayes Factor?

\item t-SNE plot of the admixture proportions??..Is that required? Depends on how we present t-SNE. If this goes to discussion, we will avoid it here

\end{itemize}
