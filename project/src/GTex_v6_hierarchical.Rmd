## Overview

In this script, we perform the hierarchical clustering on the GTEx V6 cis-gene level data. The  data comprises of $8555$ tissue samples with expression levels recorded for $16069$ cis-genes chosen appropriately. 

The main purpose for performing  hierarchical clustering is to compare the system time in performing hierarchical clustering and comparing it with the time taken to perform admixture. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

rm(list=ls())
library(data.table)
#install_github('kkdey/maptpx') 
library(maptpx)
library(CountClust)
library(data.table)

data <- data.frame(fread('../external_data/GTEX_V6/cis_gene_expression.txt'));



```
