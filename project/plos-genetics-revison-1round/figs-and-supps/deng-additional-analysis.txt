GoM doesn't pick up the three cell types in K=5 as found in Guo et al, either in the 48 genes or all the genes. However, we do see some correlations of these genes with the admixtures (K=5). When looking at the expression pattern of these 48 genes in the Deng data using other methods, we did not find the same pattern as they found in Guo et al. (Note that there are two control genes and we don't know yet what their behaviors/purposes) Look at their cell-type specific genes and see their relationship between our admixture probabilities. Focus on the purple and orange clusters. How many genes distinguish these
