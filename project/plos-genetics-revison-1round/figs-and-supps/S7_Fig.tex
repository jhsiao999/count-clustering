{\bf GTEx brain tissue samples visualization using (A) principle component analysis, (B) t-SNE, and (C) Multidimensional scaling.}
The colors represent the 13 different brain tissue types. In (A) and (B), the majority of the tissue samples are distinct from Cerebellum tissue samples (the cluster of samples located on the right side of the plot). While, in (C), most tissue samples are located at the enter of the plot and are similar to each other in the t-SNE dimensions.
