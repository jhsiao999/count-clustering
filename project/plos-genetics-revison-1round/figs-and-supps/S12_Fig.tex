{\bf Dendrogram representation for GTEx all tissues level data.} Dendrogram representation of the 8555 GTEx tissue samples across all the tissues.
The hierarchical clustering in this case has been performed on the log counts per million (cpm) data.
Very clearly, samples from different tissues seem to cluster together, but any further patterns, for instance, how similar different tissue types are, is hard to see.
