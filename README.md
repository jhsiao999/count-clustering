# count-clustering
a repo for Kushal's work related to rna seq clustering etc


In this repo, the R scripts, relevant plots and documents on the Count clustering project have been stored.

`src` holds the R scripts, RmD scripts and corresponding HTML files

`docs` sketch for the paper we are writing on this work

`plots` plots of phase diagrams and some old Jaitin plots, will update the GTEX plots and the Zeisel plots

`internal_data` the data that are obtained though post hoc analysis or for theoretical discussion. Contains phase matrices now

`old_codes`  contains old codes, not directly required for the paper, but may be neded later

Details on old_codes:


There are 6 folders in the old_codes folder-

In each of these subfolders, I have kept a RmD file that contains the entire code starting from simulation, to 
preprocessing to final estimation. Anyone trying to replicate the analysis only needs to run this RmD script and he or she 
should get the output to the entire analysis. I have kept the HTML file obtained from one run of this RmD script in these
subfolders, so that one has ease in going through the plots or the source

Also, the Jaitin data set for 1041 cells as used by jaitin et al has been analyzed and the relevant plots for that analysis
are in the Data analysis folder.
